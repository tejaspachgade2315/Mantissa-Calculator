This project is a mantissa calculator with a 23-bit precision. The purpose of this calculator is to calculate the mantissa of a number, which is the fractional part of a logarithm or a floating-point number.
Traditionally, calculating a 23-bit mantissa can be a time-consuming task for students. To address this issue, I have created a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator incorporates a custom function that was initially written in Java and then converted into JavaScript.
By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have developed a user-friendly interface for the calculator. Users can input the desired number, and the calculator will perform the necessary calculations to determine the 23-bit mantissa. The conversion of the Java function to JavaScript ensures that the calculator can be easily accessed and used within a web browser.
Overall, This project aims to simplify the process of calculating a 23-bit mantissa by providing a convenient and efficient tool for students.


# Mantissa Calculator

App is logically correct

Bugs/features that need to be solved/added :

Make a check for input number if greater than or equal to one display("Input number cannot be more than or equal to one")

Modify user interface

Result button changing position after calculation mantissa

Add backspace button to improve user experience

Clear button should clear input as well as result value

This calculator deals with the mantissa of single-precision bit number i.e(23-bit). what about double-precision bit number (52 bit )
